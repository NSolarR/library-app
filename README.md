# What is this project?
    This is a project given by The Odin Project curriculum.
    The goal of it is to create a library app that you
    can input books you want to read or have read into
    it. Also going to be storing that info
    on the users computer. This is also meant to test 
    my knowledge of prototypes.

# Pre project thoughts
    I'm kinda worried about this project. I'm
    having a hard time grasping the whole prototypes
    and constructor thing. Will probably take a bit
    to figure out but I seem to learn best by doing
    so I'm also looking forward to starting.

    The game plan is:

        -Need a button to add a new book
        
        -Take input of title, author,
        #pages, and readStatus.

        -Once user inputs that data, it
        should create a new object using
        the prototype of Book, then store
        it in an array.

        -User should be able to remove
        bookss from their library.

        -User should also be able to edit
        their book info.
        
        -Once all the logic is laid out,
        make the app look pretty.
